### Hi there! I'm glad you here!
### This is my first post.
### It's fantastic to use R programming languange in HTML.

Take a look in these two packages for newbies in R...
* [Cowsay package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowsay/vignettes/cowsay_tutorial.html)
```{r cowsay, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(cowsay)
say("Hello world!", "cow")
```

* [Fortunes package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fortunes/vignettes/fortunes.pdf) - Collected Wisdom in R
```{r}
library(fortunes)
fortune()
```
