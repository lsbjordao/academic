CARO:0000000 'anatomical entity' is defined as: A part of a cellular organism that is either an immaterial entity or a material entity with granularity aboove the level of a protein complex.  Or, a substance produced by a cellular organism with granularity above the level of a protein complex.  Refers to BFO:0000004 'independent continuant'.","'Part' includes both proper parts and the whole plant. CARO:0000003 'connected anatomical structure' is defined as: Material anatomical entity that is a single connected structure with inherent 3D shape, generated by coordinated expression of the organism's own genome.","Most multi-tissue plant structures have at least a small connection to other plant structures via a fiat boundary, such as where a leaf (PO:0025034) connects to a shoot axis (PO:0025029), a petal (PO:0009032) connects to a receptacle (PO:0009064), or a branch (PO:0025073) connects to a stem (PO:0009047).  Refers to CARO:0000055 multi-tissue structure, def'n: Anatomical structure that has as parts two or more portions of tissue of at least two different types, and which through specific morphogenetic processes, form a single distinct structural unit demarcated by bona-fide boundries from other structural units of differnt types.","Examples include stem (PO:0009047), leaf (PO:0025034), and root (PO:0009005). May include individual plant cells (PO:0009002) that are not part of a portion of plant tissue (e.g., idioblasts, PO:0000283). A plant organ may have one or more different plant organs as parts, such as a sporophyll (PO:0009026) that may have as part a sporangium (PO:0025094) or a carpel (PO:0009030) that may have as part a plant ovule (PO:0020003).","In bryophytes, particularly in mosses, a sporangium is referred to as a capsule. In seed plants, a sporangium is located in a sporophyll. In pteridophytes, a sporangium is located on the surface of a sporophyll or fertile leaf or borne on a sporangiophore. May be unicellular in some algae.",null,"In seed plants, the megaspores and megagametophyte are retained within the nucellus. If you are annotating to this structure for an angiosperm, please add an additional annotation to plant ovary ovule (PO:0025490). If you are annotating to this structure for an gymnosperm, please add an additional annotation to ovuliferous scale ovule (PO:0025491). If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352).",null,"A pollen sac is a microsporangium in seed plants. In angiosperms, a single, unfused pollen sac may contain an anther locule or several pollen sacs may fuse so they contain a single anther locule. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), tassel floret (PO:0006310), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006313), lower floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006315), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316).","A fruit (PO:0009001) may contain additional plant structures (PO:0009011) that were part of a flower (PO:0009046) and mature along with the gynoecium, such as a receptacle (PO:0009064). A fruit may develop without fertilization in cases of parthenocarpy, apomixis, or other hormone-induced conditions and may not always contain seeds (PO:0009010). When annotating to fruit (PO:0009001) that are referred to as â€˜aggregateâ€™, â€˜multipleâ€™, or â€˜compoundâ€™, please annotate directly to the appropriate plant structure, such as receptacle, hypanthium (PO:0009065) or infructescence (PO:0006342). Fruits only occur in angiosperms.","Examples: pepper (Capsicum annuum), papaya (Carica papaya), avocado (Persea americana), may apple (Podophyllum peltatum), date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), potato (Solanum tuberosum), chocolate (Theobroma cacao), blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), and grape (Vitis vinifera).","A hesperidium fruit (PO:0030109) develops from a superior gynoecium (PO:0009062), and therefore is not surrounded by receptacle (PO:0009064) tissue. Examples: orange, grapefruit, lemon, and lime (Citrus spp.).","Examples: milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) and carolina larkspur (Delphinium carolinianum).","Caryopsis fruit (PO:0030104) is characteristic of the Poaceae (the grass family). Caryopsis fruits develop from a pseudomonomerous gyneocium (PO:0009062), and contain only a single seed due to the abortion of two of the three carpels (PO:0009030). The pericarp of caryopsis fruits of some bamboo species is somewhat fleshy at maturity and is fused to the seed coat; these fruits are referred to in the literature as bacoid caryopses. Examples: barley (Hordeum vulgare), rice (Oryza spp.), wheat (Triticum spp.), corn (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), oat (Avena spp.), zebra grass (Miscanthus spp.), Tauschâ€™s goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii), stiff brome (Brachypodium distachyon), cutgrass (Leersia perrieri), and foxtail millet (Setaria italica).","Plant structures commonly referred to as â€˜accessoryâ€™ (such as strawberry) or multiple fruits (such as figs..) which are comprised of accrescent receptacle (PO:0009064) or infructescence (PO:0006342) tissue, contain as parts achene fruits (PO:0030107). For example, when annotating for a gene involved in strawberry development, any gene of interest that is involved in the development of the receptacle tissue would be mapped to receptacle (PO:0009064); genes involved in sepal (PO:0009031) persistence or accrescence would map to sepal (PO:0009031), and those involved in fruit characteristics would be mapped to achene (PO:0030107). Examples: sunflower (Helianthus annuus),  strawberry (Fragaria spp.), fig (Ficus sp.), and marijuana (Cannabis sativa).","In contrast to legume fruit (PO:0030100), silique fruit develop from a syncarpous (multicarpellate) gynoecium (PO:0009062) separated by a false septum (replum, PO:0025267), which persists through fruit maturity. Examples: members of Brassicaceae, lyrate rockcress (Arabidopsis lyrata), mouse-ear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea), field mustard (Brassica rapa), and pink shepherd's purse (Capsella rubella).","Legume fruit (PO:0030100) is characteristic of the plant family Fabaceae. Examples: pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), peanut (Arachis hypogaea), soybean (Glycine max), and lentil (Lens culinaris subsp. culinaris).","The pericarp (PO:0009084) of some legume fruit (PO:0030100), such as peanuts, is constricted between each seed, but these constrictions are due to a lack of support of the pericarp (PO:0009084) in the space between the seeds (PO:0009010). Contrastingly, the constrictions in the pericarp of loment fruits (PO:0030101) are sclerified and contain regions where cell death leads to disarticulation of the fruit (PO:0009001). Examples: some members of Fabaceae, including Mimosa and Desmodium spp.","May develop from an inferior or superior carpel (PO:0009030) and may contain one or more seeds (PO:0009010). Examples: Amborella trichopoda (basal angiosperm), coffee (Coffea canephora), Cornaceae (Davidia spp.), cashew (Anacardium occidentale), coconut (Cocos nucifera), and almond, peach and plum (Prunus spp.).","The common names of some species do not accurately reflect their fruit type. For example, the fruit (PO:0009001) of the peanut plant is a legume fruit (PO:0030100) rather than a nut fruit (PO:0030102). Example: pecan (Carya illinoinensis), walnut (Juglans regia), pistachio (Pistacia vera), lotus (Nelumbo nucifera), and acorn (Quercus spp.).","A pome fruit (PO:0030110) is a specialized type of berry fruit (PO:0030108) which is encapsuled in persistent, accrescent receptacle (PO:0009064) and/or hypanthium (PO:0009065) tissue. Examples: Apple, crab apple, and pear (Malus spp. and Pyrus spp.)","A pepo fruit (PO:0030111) is specialized type of berry fruit (PO:0030108) which is encapsuled by persistent, accrescent receptacle (PO:0009064) tissue. The rind, or tough outer covering, of pepo fruits comprises receptical tissue and at least the exocarp (PO:0009085) layer of the pericarp (PO:0009084). Examples: pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and  banana (Musa acuminata).","Capsule fruits (PO:0030091) are divided into subcategories depending upon the location of sutures in the pericarp (PO:0009084) that the seeds (PO:0009010) are released through.","The pericarp (PO:0009084) can be expanded laterally or radially. The wing-shaped fruits of maples (Acer spp.) are often mistakenly identified as samara fruits (PO:0030099), but are instead schizocarp fruits (PO:0030098) with samaroid mericarps (PO:0020075).\\nExamples: green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanicum) and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima).","Each individual carpellate unit of a schizocarp fruit (PO:0030098) is a mericarp (PO:0020075). Examples: maple (Acer spp.) and cassava (Manihot esculenta)."]},"edges":{"from":["10","4","2","7","5","6","8","9","3","23","25","24","17","18","20","19","14","13","16","15","11","12","21","22"],"to":["3","3","1","6","4","5","5","8","2","10","10","10","10","17","10","10","10","10","10","10","10","11","11","11"],"label":["is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a","is_a"],"arrows":["to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to","to"]},"nodesToDataframe":true,"edgesToDataframe":true,"options":{"width":"100%","height":"100%","nodes":{"shape":"dot"},"manipulation":{"enabled":false}},"groups":null,"width":null,"height":null,"idselection":{"enabled":false},"byselection":{"enabled":false},"main":null,"submain":null,"footer":null,"background":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
