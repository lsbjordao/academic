I have experience and interest in teaching and research. I started my professional career worked as a teacher of Science and Biology in elementary and high school for four years and four months. I also worked as facilitator of environmental education for ten months. Later, I taught classes in postgraduate courses, what I continue to do. Regarding research, I'm an expert in the taxonomy of the genus *Mimosa* (Leguminosae) and also interested in the fields of nomenclature, systematics, phylogeny and biogeography. In my master research, I developed floristic and taxonomic studies of *Mimosa* in the state of Rio de Janeiro/RJ, Brazil. In my PhD research, I carried out phylogenetic studies using molecular data and a taxonomic revision of four series within *Mimosa*. I have experience managing and digitalization of biological collections, particularly of herbaria collections, from when I worked on the [Reflora Programme](https://reflora.jbrj.gov.br/reflora/PrincipalUC/PrincipalUC.do). I also have experience in molecular analysis laboratories, performing DNA extraction, electrophoresis, amplification and sanger sequencing, from when I worked at [Recursos Genéticos e Biotecnologia - Cenargen](https://www.embrapa.br/recursos-geneticos-e-biotecnologia) during my PhD. As a technician, I carried out consultancy work for botanical identification, floristic survey and forest inventories. In 2020, I started working as an analyst at CNCFLora/JBRJ, when I started programming in R. Currently, I am interested in programming in R, JavaScript, App Script and Google Earth Engine, as well as cloud computing applications. Recently, the program developed at CNCFlora/JBRJ to use MapBiomas data to facilitate the process of assessing the conservation status of Brazilian flora species was awarded at the [4th edition of the MapBiomas Award](https://lsbjordao.netlify.app/publication/premio-mapbiomas/). I also teach environmental law and forensic botany at [Bioforense course](www.bioforense.com.br).
