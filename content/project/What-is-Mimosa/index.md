- *Mimosa* is a megadiverse Neotropical genus, with about 700 species, and ca. 40 species in Old World, but several species became pantropical.  

> See the [post](https://lsbjordao.netlify.com/post/crie-mapas-com-o-pacote-leaflet-do-r-usando-dados-do-gbif-maps-api/) showing the distribution of *Mimosa* on the `Leaflet` R package ([Cheng et al. 2018](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/leaflet.pdf)).   

- *Mimosa* L. belongs to clade Mimosoid, within the family Leguminosae ([LPWG 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.12705/661.3)).  

- The most comprehensive phylogenetic study of Mimosa proved its monophyletic status ([Simon et al. 2011](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1000520)).   

- The last taxonomic revision of the genus was performed by [Barneby (1991)](http://antbase.org/ants/publications/nybg/Mimosa%20NY-Botanical_gardens_Vol.%2065%20-%20Copy.pdf).

- *Mimosa* is characterized by its bipinnate and paripinnate leaves, 3–6-merous flowers, iso- or diplostemonous, and articulated or non-articulated craspedium fruit, and differs from other similar mimosoids by the 6-12 stamens and  absence of glands on the anthers (Barneby 1991, [Barroso et al. 1999](https://www.google.com.br/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjMwqH9q43iAhWXGrkGHXW-AhIQFjAIegQICRAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scielo.br%2Fscielo.php%3Fscript%3Dsci_nlinks%26ref%3D000094%26pid%3DS0101-3122200800020001800001%26lng%3Dpt&usg=AOvVaw3LSkJeELCWqgqe7bpP5Bx6)).

### *Mimosa* is especially distinguished by two *sui generis* leaf structures:  

1. **paraphyllidia**
  + Pair of leaf-like projections developed between the pinna-pulvinus and the first pair of leaflets
  + often present
  + form/shape: often  linear, lanceolate, short-triangular, or oval with acute apex

2. **spicule**  
  + Projection developed at the interpinnal space on abaxial face of the leaf-rachis
  + present or absent
  + form/shape: short-triangular (or conical) (as in *M. arenosa*), linear-subulate (as in *M. diplotricha*), or spiniform (as in *M. pigra*).

### The presence of leaf-nectaries is rare in the genus  
1. Only present in *M. sect. Mimadenia* Barneby
  + Composed by only 16 species
  + The only monophyletic section in the genus, according Barneby's (1991) infrageneric classification, and sister group of all other Mimosa groups ([Simon et al. 2011](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1000520))
    + Hence, the presence of leaf-nectaries is a plesiomorphic trait.
