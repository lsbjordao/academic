- *Mimosa* is a megadiverse Neotropical genus, with about 700 species, and ca. 40 species in Old World, but several species became pantropical.  

> See the [post](https://lsbjordao.netlify.com/post/crie-mapas-com-o-pacote-leaflet-do-r-usando-dados-do-gbif-maps-api/) showing the distribution of *Mimosa* on the `Leaflet` R package ([Cheng et al. 2018](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/leaflet.pdf)).   

- *Mimosa* L. belongs to clade Mimosoid, within the family Leguminosae ([LPWG 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.12705/661.3)).  

- The most comprehensive phylogenetic study of *Mimosa* proved its monophyletic status ([Simon et al. 2011](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1000520)).   
![simon et al.'s (2011) Mimosa phylogeny](https://lsbjordao.netlify.com/img/what-is-mimosa/M_phylogeny_Simon2011_adapt.png)

- The last taxonomic revision of the genus was performed by [Barneby (1991)](http://antbase.org/ants/publications/nybg/Mimosa%20NY-Botanical_gardens_Vol.%2065%20-%20Copy.pdf).

- *Mimosa* is characterized by its bipinnate and paripinnate leaves, capitate or spicate inflorescence, 3–6-merous flowers, iso- or diplostemonous, and craspedium fruit, with articulated or non-articulated epicarp, and differs from other similar mimosoids by the 6-12 stamens and  absence of glands on the anthers (Barneby 1991, [Barroso et al. 1999](https://www.google.com.br/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjMwqH9q43iAhWXGrkGHXW-AhIQFjAIegQICRAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scielo.br%2Fscielo.php%3Fscript%3Dsci_nlinks%26ref%3D000094%26pid%3DS0101-3122200800020001800001%26lng%3Dpt&usg=AOvVaw3LSkJeELCWqgqe7bpP5Bx6)).

### *Mimosa* is especially distinguished by two *sui generis* leaf structures:  

1. **paraphyllidia**
  + Pair of leaf-like projections developed between the pinna-pulvinus and the first pair of leaflets
  + often present
  + form/shape: often  linear, lanceolate, short-triangular (or conic), or oval with acute apex
![Paraphyllidia of M. bimucronata](https://lsbjordao.netlify.com/img/what-is-mimosa/M_bimucronata_paraphyllidia.png "Paraphyllidia of Mimosa bimucronata")  <center> Short-triangular (or conic) Paraphyllidia of *M. bimucronata* </center>

2. **spicule**  
  + Projection developed at the interpinnal space on abaxial face of  leaf-rachis
  + present or absent
  + form/shape: short-triangular (or conic), linear-subulate, or spiniform

### The presence of leaf-nectaries is rare in the genus  
1. Only present in *M. sect. Mimadenia* Barneby
  + Composed by only 16 species
  + The only monophyletic section in the genus, according Barneby's (1991) infrageneric classification, and sister group of all other Mimosa groups ([Simon et al. 2011](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1000520))
    + Hence, the presence of leaf-nectaries is a plesiomorphic trait ![Leaf-nectary of M. extensa](https://lsbjordao.netlify.com/img/what-is-mimosa/M_extensa_leaf-nectary.png "Leaf-nectary of M. extensa") <center> Leaf-nectary of *M. extensa* </center>  

### Recognize different types of trichomes is very important for species identification

The main types of trichomes are:

1. Filiform
  + Simple (not-branched), uniseriate

2. Setiform
  + Simple (not-branched, but sometimes with minute projections), multiseriate

3. Stellate
  + Multiangulate branched, sessile, subsessile, or stalked, peduncle multiseriate

4. Dendritic
  + Branched
