- *Mimosa* L. belongs to clade Mimosoid, within the family Leguminosae ([LPWG 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.12705/661.3)).  

- The most comprehensive phylogenetic study of Mimosa proved its monophyletic status ([Simon et al. 2011](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3732/ajb.1000520)).   

- *Mimosa* is a megadiverse Neotropical genus, with about 700 species, and ca. 40 species in Old World, but several species became pantropical.  

- The last taxonomic revision of the genus was performed by [Barneby (1991)](http://antbase.org/ants/publications/nybg/Mimosa%20NY-Botanical_gardens_Vol.%2065%20-%20Copy.pdf).
